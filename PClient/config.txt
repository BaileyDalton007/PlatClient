This is the config file for Plat Client, changing things in here may cause errors in
your program's runtime. Feel free to see discord to ask questions or read up on
the full explaination of all of these settings.

CONFIG FILE IS ONLY UPDATED ON PROGRAM REBOOT. Be sure to close and reopen the client
for changes to occur

Under each option in brackets [], there are the option values that a setting can have




INGAME

zoomEnabled = 0
[0, 1]
toggles if the zoom function is active or not

zoomKey = 0x5A
[see MSDN page below for hex codes (will start with "0x")]
sets the key to hold down for zoom function the default is the Z key (0x5A), see 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes for other keycodes




DISCORD

discordPresence = 1
[0, 1]
toggles if the Clients Discord Rich Presence is displayed (the fancy status thing)

showIgn = 1
[0, 1]
toggles if the Clients Discord Rich Presence displays ign of account currently being played on
(hover over purple circle)



OVERLAY

Youtube

youtubeAPIkey = 
youtubeChannelID = 
[see discord or video on how to set up youtube stats]
API key and channel id used to query the youtube api for a channel name and subcount
to display on the overlay

displayScale = 4
[any integer above 0]
If your channel name is long and goes out of the box, slowy bump this up, as it stretches
the box in the x direction. I suggest keeping this below 7, but test and see what works
for you.


Keystrokes and CPS

showKeyStrokes = 1
[0, 1]
toggles the rendering of keystrokes (WASD) on the overlay

showCPS = 1
[0, 1]
toggles if CPS (clicks per second) are displayed on the overlay

keyStrokeX = 200
[number above 0]
the distance from the keystrokes to the right side of the minecraft window
play around with this value, as it will be different on every res monitor.
If left blank the default is 200.

keyStrokeY = 200
[number above 0]
the distance from the keystrokes to the top of the minecraft window
play around with this value, as it will be different on every res monitor.
If left blank the default is 200.
